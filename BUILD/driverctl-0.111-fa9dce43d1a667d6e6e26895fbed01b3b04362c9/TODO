Limitations / future ideas
--------------------------

- PCI slot numbers are not really static, it'd be good to support some
  other means of addressing a given device. However prior to loading
  an actual driver there isn't much data to go on with, just about
  the only thing is the actual pci-id which *is* static and reliable
  but using it'd mean overriding all such devices. Which might be a
  better option than not being able to do it at all.
- Rewrite it in some real programming language
- In current kernels (as of 4.6.x) very limited number of subsystems
  support driver_override. The rest could be supported if we used
  the older unbind/bind mechanism, but I'm lazy.
- Some devices might need overriding in the initrd phase already,
  add dracut integration
- Rewrite in an actual programming language (read: C)
